The whole mask itself was soaked in a hypo solution (sodium thiosulphate and glycerine) and worn tucked into the soldier's tunic. This process proved effective against chlorine gas, however the mask's fragile eye piece was prone to damage. The mask also had no expiratory valve, and as a result, the wearer was forced to breath his own recycled air. Intact Hypo Helmets are extremely rare today, as most were disposed of or deteriorated over the years.</li></ul>

It was made from two separate layers of flannelette, and was soaked in a new solution of sodium phenolate and glycerine. This mixture gave sufficient protection from both Chlorine and Phosgene. The mask also used two circular glass eye pieces instead of a single visor made from fragile mica or celluloid, improving the mask's durability. In addition to this, an exhale valve was also added in the form of a rubber flapper valve on the outside, and a short pipe on the inside, which was held in the mouth. Later, the solution was improved upon by adding hexamethylene-tetramine (hexamine), and thus the mask became known as the PH Helmet. P and PH Helmets are very scarce today, and when found are typically missing the external flapper type exhale valve.</li></ul>

The "box" (now commonly known as a filter) consisted of a metal tin filled with highly absorbent charcoal mixed with layers of granulated alkaline perm-agnate. The box was connected to the mask via a short corrugated rubber hose, which was fixed to a metal pipe. The metal pipe served as both the mask's inlet and outlet assembly. It went into the mask and connected to a snorkel shaped mouth piece which was held between the teeth. Both inhaled and exhaled air went via the mouth, and to prevent nose breathing, a nostril clip was also incorporated inside the mask. Exhaled air was breathed back out along the black metal pipe, and exited via a flapper type check valve outside the mask (missing from the example at right). The face piece consisted of a baggy rubberized fabric that allowed the wearer to wipe condensation from the cellulose eye pieces while the mask was worn. This was accomplished by pushing in the fabric next to the eye pieces with a finger from outside the mask. The Small Box Respirator's design was later copied in the US, and as a result many early US gas mask designs were based on the original British design.</li></ul>

A flat metal loop was attached to the metal pipe which housed the rubber flapper type exhale valve.

The remaining features of the mask were not changed, however the mask's face piece may have been reinforced with some extra cement around the edges. The head harness configuration and nose clip assembly did not change. This version of the mask seems to be slightly more rare than the first type.</li></ul>

Both the face piece and the corrugated hose were made from molded rubber covered in a stockinette material. The mask was carried in a tan haversack which was worn in the chest position.</li></ul>

Millions of these masks were issued as part of a historically large civilian defense program that took place in Great Britain during the war. The mask was very simple, made from thin sheet rubber with a single clear plastic visor of cellulose acetate. There was no exhale valve and only a three strap head harness to hold the mask in place.</li></ul>

The helmet was intended for infants and small children that could not use the Small Child's Respirator effectively. It consisted of a metal frame attached to a rubberized fabric bag, with a large plastic visor framed by leather attached to the front. The child could be inserted into the contraption via an opening in the bottom. He/she was then strapped in and secured with legs dangling from the bottom. The care taker could then carry the child around easily and pump in filtered air via a bellows system on the side. The Infant Carrier was manufactured in large numbers by several companies, giving rise to some variation of assembled units. There was also a very similar device manufactured in Canada, based directly on the British Baby's Anti-Gas Helmet.</li></ul>

The mask was later made from bright orange colored rubber, which was designed to ease the anxiety commonly felt among children when required to don the mask.

The Mk.1 used a face piece derived from the earlier Civilian Duty Respirator, with a fully molded face piece and two circular glass eye pieces. A 60mm threaded inlet was positioned on the left side of the masks face piece. Here is where a removable drum type filter canister could be attached. A large exhale valve was positioned on the front of the mask, further reducing breathing resistance. This successful design gave the fighting soldier greater dexterity in the field and allowed for at least right-handed soldiers to properly sight their rifles from the shoulder position. The Mk.1 Light Anti-Gas Respirator was also the primary inspiration for the US M5-11-7 Assault Service Gas Mask. The Mk.1 is quite common, and can usually be found in good condition with its small green carrier.</li></ul>
