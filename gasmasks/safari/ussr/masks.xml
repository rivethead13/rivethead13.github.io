        <Notes>Notes:  The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, commonly known as the Soviet Union  was a constitutionally socialist state that existed in Eurasia between 1922 and 1991.The Soviet Union had a single-party political system dominated by the Communist Party until 1990. Although the USSR was nominally a union of Soviet republics (15 in all after 1956) with the capital in Moscow, it was actually a highly centralized state with a planned economy. The Russian Revolution of 1917 brought about the downfall of the Russian Empire. After the Bolsheviks won the ensuing Russian Civil War, the Soviet Union was founded in December 1922. Following the death of the first Soviet leader, Vladimir Lenin, in 1924, Joseph Stalin eventually won a power struggle and led the country through a large-scale industrialization with a command economy and political repression. In World War II, in June 1941, Germany and its allies invaded the Soviet Union. After four years of brutal warfare, the Soviet Union emerged victorious as one of the world's two superpowers, the other being the United States. The Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellite states engaged in the Cold War, a prolonged global ideological and political struggle against the United States and its Western Bloc allies, which it ultimately lost in the face of economic troubles and both domestic and foreign political unrest. In the late 1980s, the last Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev tried to reform the state with his policies of perestroika and glasnost, but the Soviet Union collapsed and was formally dissolved in December 1991 after the abortive August coup attempt. The Russian Federation assumed its rights and obligations.
            Due to a large Civil Defense Program and the USSR's breakdown there are large numbers of Russian gas masks on the military surplus Market. Making masks made by the USSR the most common found Today.

        <Notes>Notes:  During WWII, the Soviets developed an updated version of the WWI Zelinsky-Kumant mask for military and civilian use. It used a helmet design similar to its WWI predecessor, but was made of thick molded rubber instead of glued sheet rubber. The face piece was referred to as the Шлем-Маска (Helmet Mask) but was also sometime called the БН-T5, which referred to it being an Army mask that used the T-5 type filter canister. A long corrugated breathing hose connected the face piece to the large metal filter unit, which was carried in a satchel at the wearer's side. A 'flapper' type exhale valve protected by a metal guard was also part of the assembly. When in use, the rubber protrusion between the eyes was turned in, to allow the wearer to insert a finger and wipe condensation from the eye pieces. Like all early Soviet gas masks, this type is quite scarce today as most were discarded after the end of the war.</Notes>

    <Notes>Notes:  During WWII, the Маска 0-8 was issued to the Soviet Red Army and also possibly to civilians and civil defense personnel. The mask was made of thin but durable rubber and was assembled with a long breathing tube and a Т-Ч type filter canister. There was no inner mask, making the Маска 0-8 prone to fogging. Although they are very much alike, the Маска 0-8 should not be confused with the Маска МОД-0-8 (Mask MOD-O-8), a similar mask used during the same time period (see below). Like all WWII Russian masks, the Маска 0-8 is now very scarce and difficult to find in any condition.</Notes>

    <Notes>Notes:  The Маска МОД-0-8 is another mask used by the Soviet military during WWII. It is possible that it was meant to be an updated version of the Маска 0-8, as its features are very similar. However, the Маска 0-8 did not have an inner mask or any Tissot tubes, making it prone to fogging, but the МОД-0-8 used a single tube on the inside of the mask to help reduce condensation on the eye pieces. The face piece is also slightly larger, and the rubber used was a bit thicker. This most likely made the МОД-0-8 more durable and possibly more comfortable. Like the Маска 0-8, the МОД-0-8 is very scarce today, and when found is usually in poor co nditio n.</Notes>

    <Notes>Notes:  The WWII ШМ-1 is quite an important mask. Its design was the basis for a series of helmet type masks that went on to be used for decades after WWII. The former Soviet Union used several variations of the ШМ-1 for military, civilian and industrial purposes well into the 1980s. Many other countries, including most of the Warsaw Pact states and even China used helmet styled masks derived directly from the Soviet models. The early ШМ-1 looks almost identical to its modern counter-parts, but there are several things that distinguish it from later versions. Most notably, the Tissot styled tubes on the inside of the mask are separate, black rubber pipes that were not part of the mask's face piece mold. The version pictured to the right is of the earliest type, with a metal band used to secure the inlet/outlet assembly instead of the later and more commonly used crimped metal assembly (see ШМ-1 below) Today, WWII era ШМ-1 gas masks are quite scarce in any condition.</Notes>

    <Notes>Notes:  This version of the ШМ-1 is a post war model which used a new face piece mold that integrated the Tissot tubes on the inside of the mask. This change most likely reduced production costs and increased efficiency. It also probably made the mask more comfortable and enhanced the demisting of the eye pieces. This seems to be the only major design change that mask underwent during this time, however the mold was again updated in the 1970s again, but the changes were slight and almost unno ticeable.</Notes>

    <Notes>Notes:  The ИП-46 is an early Soviet rebreather system most likely used on board ships or inside tanks. The mask consisted of a 'helmet' type face piece that was attached to an elbow shaped metal pipe and corrugated hose tube. The rebreather unit was carried in a large canvas satchel in the chest position. Like all rebreather units, the ИП-46 was most likely intended for use during emergency rescue and escape situations. The ИП-46 went on to be used after WWII for industrial applications.</Notes>

    <Notes>Notes:  The ГП-2 is a rare, early Russian mask issued to civilians during WWII. It features a fixed filter unit and a protected exhale valve on the left side of the face piece. The eye pieces are made from a thin transparent plastic similar to many other civilian masks from other countries. The ГП-2 is a simple mask and most likely only offered a limited amount of protection. It is also important to note that a later version of the ГП-2 was also manufactured (see below), fabricated from slightly different materials. ГП-2 gas masks are extremely rare today, and are typically quite expensive when found.</Notes>

    <Notes>Notes:  During WWII, the Soviet Army produced several different protective masks for horses. The mask pictured to the right was made of fabrisized rubber with two built in filter elements on each side. The mask fit over the horse's snout, and was then strapped to the animal's head via a series of belts. A similar mask was made during the 1950s and used in the USSR, Poland and possibly some other Eastern Bloc countries (see below).</Notes>
