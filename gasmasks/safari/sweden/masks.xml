            <Notes>Notes: Sweden remained officially neutral during World War I and World War II, although its neutrality during World War II has been disputed. Sweden was under German influence for much of the war, as ties to the rest of the world were cut off through blockades. The Swedish government felt that it was in no position to openly contest Germany, and therefore made some concessions. Sweden also supplied steel and machined parts to Germany throughout the war. However, Sweden supported Norwegian resistance, and in 1943 helped rescue Danish Jews from deportation to concentration camps. Sweden also supported Finland in the Winter War and the Continuation War with volunteers and materiel. Sweden was officially a neutral country and remained outside NATO or Warsaw pact membership during the cold war, but privately Sweden's leadership had strong ties with the United States and other western governments.</Notes>

    <Notes>Notes:  The Swedish m/31 was made of rubberized canvas and was equipped with a long corrugated breathing tube and a large filter canister. For suspension, a five point elastic head harness was used in conjunction with an elastic neck strap. A circular exhale valve was positioned just below the inlet for the breathing tube. The m/31 was carried in a large fabric haversack.</Notes>

    <Notes>Notes:  This unknown Swedish mask was most likely equipped with a long breathing tube and filter canister, or possibly a single drum type canister in the snout position. The mask's design is similar to other Swedish masks from WWII, but seems to be considerably more rare.</Notes>

    <Notes>Notes:  This Swedish mask was also of a simple design and was most likely issued as a civilian or civil defense mask. It is possible that this was a late war mask which was designed to use less metal for its construction. The filter was made from a lighter alloy and the exhale valve was moved over and positioned on the left side of the mask. A lighter metal was also used for the eye piece rims as well.</Notes>

    <Notes>Notes:  The Typ 15 mask was one of many similar civilian masks manufactured by different companies in Sweden during WWII. This version, made by Nordover, was made from think black sheet rubber with a small filter canister fixed on the front. The mask was cheaply made with no exhale valve or method for changing the filter. All exhaled air had to pass either back through the filter or out through the sides of the mask. The Typ 15 was issued in a thin cardboard carrying box.</Notes>

    <Notes>Notes:  The Bicapa Typ 19 is another cheaply made civilian mask very similar to the Nordover Typ 15. However, the Typ 19 seems to be made a little better with thick, sturdy eye piece rims and slightly thicker rubber. Like the Typ 15, the Typ 19 also had no exhale valve which meant all expired air had to be pushed out through the filter or the sides of the mask.</Notes>

    <Notes>Notes:  The Garanti Typ 21 is another of the many WWII Swedish civilian gas masks manufactured during this time. However, the Typ 21 used a noticeably different filter cartridge when compared to the other civilian masks made by other manufacturers. It was also issued in a small cardboard box.</Notes>

    <Notes>Notes:  The Typ 32 is a post war upgrade of the WWII styled civilian masks. It was made from gray sheet rubber and was issued in a blue and yellow, cylindrical cardboard container. Like the earlier Swedish civilian masks, the Typ 32 was a cheaply made mask that offered a minimal amount of protection.</Notes>

    <Notes>Notes:  The Swedish Typ 33 is a modern civilian mask that designed to offer a higher lever of protection and comfort. The mask was made from soft gray rubber, and it featured a single plastic visor and an elastic head harness. The mask came with a single fixed filter which was integrated into the front of the mask. An inner nose cup was also installed to reduce fogging. Unlike the earlier Swedish civilian masks, the Typ 33 included an exhale valve on the bottom of the mask, which certainly improved the level of protection. The Typ 33 was issued in an oval shaped, gray plastic tub.</Notes>

    <Notes>Notes:  The Skyddsmask 51 is a licensed copy of the US M9 Gas Mask, and overall it is quite similar. The Skyddsmask 51 was made from dark green rubber, and had a larger and longer exhale valve guard. The mask came in two versions, an early version that could only use an old style 60mm thread filter canister, and a newer version that had a double threaded inlet, which allowed both 60mm and 40mm thread canisters to be attached. The Skyddsmask 51 is quite common on the surplus market in the US, and can often be found in mint, un-issued condition.</Notes>

    <Notes>Notes:  The Forsheda F2 is a stylish and modern NBC respirator that is comfortable to wear and offers a drinking system and the ability to mount the filter canister on either side of the face piece. The ability to use optical inserts is also available to the F2. The F2 is not very easy to find today, as few have been released into the surplus market.</Notes>
