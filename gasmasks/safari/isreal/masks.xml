            <Notes>Notes: he modern State of Israel was declared in 1948, and traces its historical and religious roots to the Biblical Land of Israel. Israel declared independence on 14 May 1948 and neighboring Arab states invaded the next day.Since then, Israel has fought a series of wars with neighboring Arab states,[14] and has occupied territories, including the West Bank, Sinai Peninsula, Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights. Isreal has a lrage civil defense Program since all citizens must serve in the army. As such their masks are some of the most common on the market.</Notes>

    <Notes>Notes:  This Israel civilian mask is basically an upgraded Model No. 4. A drinking port was added and an inner mask incorporated to help reduce fogging, a common problem with the Model No. 4. In addition, the inlet/outlet assembly was updated and the head harness was changed from rubber to elastic. All of these changed most likely made the mask for efficient and more comfortable. This updated version is somewhat rare in the US, as fewer were im p o r t e d .</Notes>
