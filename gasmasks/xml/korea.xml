        <Notes>  On 25 June 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, sparking the Korean War, the Cold War's first major conflict. At the time, the Soviet Union had boycotted the United Nations (UN), thus forfeiting their veto rights. This allowed the UN to intervene in a civil war when it became apparent that the superior North Korean forces would unify the entire country. The Soviet Union and China backed North Korea, with the later participation of millions of Chinese troops. After huge advances on both sides, and massive losses among Korean civilians in both the north and the south, the war eventually reached a stalemate. The 1953 armistice, never signed by South Korea, split the peninsula along the demilitarized zone near the original demarcation line. No peace treaty was ever signed, resulting in the two countries remaining technically at war. At least 2.5 million people died during the Korean War

    <Notes>  The KM9A1 is a direct copy of the US M9A1. The mask is virtually identical to the US version, with a similar filter canister and carrier as well. The South Koreans also manufactured a licensed copy of the US M25A1 Tank Mask also, but like the M9A1 it is also quite rare to find either of these copies in the US.</Notes>

    <Notes>  The K1 is a newer military NBC respirator made by Samgong of Korea. It is most likely an upgrade for the earlier KM9A1, which was a copy of the US M9A1. It features a comfortable elastic head harness and the ability to attach a canteen to the right side of the face piece. A protective rubber hood is also issued with the K1. Several of these masks have been exported and sold new in various countries.</Notes>
