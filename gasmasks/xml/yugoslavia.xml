        <Notes> At 5:12 a.m. on April 6, 1941, German, Italian and Hungarian forces attacked Yugoslavia. The German Air Force (Luftwaffe) bombed Belgrade and other major Yugoslav cities. On April 17, representatives of Yugoslavia's various regions signed an armistice with Germany in Belgrade, ending 11 days of resistance against the invading German Army (Wehrmacht Heer). More than 300,000 Yugoslav officers and soldiers were taken prisoner.
The Axis Powers occupied Yugoslavia and split it up. The Independent State of Croatia was established as a Nazi satellite state, ruled by the fascist militia known as the Ustaše that came into existence in 1929, but was relatively limited in its activities until 1941. German troops occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as part of Serbia and Slovenia, while other parts of the country were occupied by Bulgaria, Hungary, and Italy. From 1941-45, the Croatian Ustaše regime murdered around 500,000 people, 250,000 were expelled, and another 200,000 were forced to convert to Catholicism; the victims were predominantly Serbs but included 37,000 Jews.</Notes>

    <Notes>  This early Yugoslavian mask, most likely issued in Slovenia, was a copy of the A.R.S. design. It may have been an exported model manufactured by the French firm S.E.C.M.P., or at least based on their designs. The mask came in a tall metal carrying canister similar to the French A.R.S. masks as well.</Notes>

    <Notes>  The M-3 is a rare Yugoslavian army mask that is very similar in design to the Czech Vz. 35. The mask's face piece was made from soft black rubber and came equipped with a long corrugated breathing hose and a large filter canister. The mask was carried in a olive drab canvas bag.</Notes>

    <Notes>  The Serbian M1 is the closest copy of the US M9 gas mask ever made. While a different color rubber was used to manufacture the mask, the overall design is an exact copy of the M9. The M1 was also issued in a similar carrying satchel. The M1 was used during the Gulf War and was possibly issued in Iraq, making it somewhat collectable among Desert Storm historians. A version of the M1 with no inner nose cup was also issued to civilians, and was designated the MC1 (see below).</Notes>

    <Notes>  The Serbian MC1 is nothing more than a civilian version of the M1 (see above). Overall the masks are identical, but the MC1 lacks an inner nose cup, making it more prone to fogging. The MC1 was also marked as such in large black letters, making it easy to tell it apart from the M1.</Notes>

    <Notes>  The Serbian Horse Gas Mask is interesting in that it is a modern mask made for horses, where most countries stopped making NBC protective devices for animals in the mid 1950s. This horse mask is large and was designed to cover the animal's entire head and neck, and was most likely used in conjunction with a gas proof cape of some type. There are even pockets in the top of the mask for the horse's ears, and two large plastic visors for the horse to see out from. The mask used dual 60mm thread filter canisters identical to the M1 and MC1 series masks.</Notes>

    <Notes>  The Serbian M2 is basically nothing more than an upgraded M1. The filter inlet was changed to accommodate a 40 mm NATO standard filter canister and the overall shape of the mask was updated. Serbian M2s are somewhat common on the surplus market and can usually be found in un-issued condition.</Notes>

    <Notes>  The Serbian M2a is basically identical to the M2, but was updated with a drinking system and a combination exhale valve/speech diaphragm assembly. The head harness, eye pieces, filter and carrier remained the same.</Notes>
