        <Notes> Germany's invasion of Denmark on 9 April 1940 – code named Operation Weserübung – met only two hours of military resistance before the Danish government surrendered. Economic co-operation between Germany and Denmark continued until 1943, when the Danish government refused further co-operation and its navy sank most of its ships and sent as many of their officers as they could to neutral Sweden. During the war, the government was helpful towards the Danish Jewish minority, and the Danish resistance performed a rescue operation that managed to get most of them to Sweden and safety shortly before the Germans planned to round up the Danish Jews. Denmark also stopped most captured Jews and political prisoners from being send to German camps by paying and supplying one in Denmark that had far better chances of survival for the prisoners. Denmark led many "inside operations" or sabotage against the German facilities. Iceland severed ties to Denmark and became an independent republic, and in 1948, the Faroe Islands gained home rule. </Notes>

    <Notes>  The Danish M.1931 was most likely based on the French A.R.S. design. The mask was most likely used by civil defense forces for air raid protection. The mask was carried in a large green carrying canister and seems to be quite rare today.</Notes>

    <Notes>  The Danish M38 is very similar to the German WWII era gas masks. The M38 was most likely issued to civilians and civil defense units. There were several different versions made, including one of black rubber (see below).</Notes>
