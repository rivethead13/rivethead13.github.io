        <Notes> . The independent Republic of Czechoslovakia was formed in 1918, following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire after World War I. After the Munich Agreement (signed by Nazi Germany, France, Britain and Italy), Polish annexation of Zaolzie and German occupation of Czechoslovakia and the consequent disillusion with the Western response and gratitude for the liberation of the major portion of Czechoslovakia by the Red Army, the Communist party won plurality (38%) in the 1946 elections. In a 1948 coup d'état, Czechoslovakia became a communist-ruled state. In 1968, the increasing dissatisfaction culminated in attempts to reform the communist regime. The events, known as the Prague Spring of 1968, ended with an invasion by the armies of the Warsaw Pact countries (with the exception of Romania); the troops remained in the country until the 1989 Velvet Revolution, when the communist regime collapsed. On 1 January 1993, Czechoslovakia peacefully dissolved into its constituent states, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</Notes>

    <Notes>  During the Warsaw Pact years, the Soviet ShM (helmet) style gas mask was used by several different eastern European countries, including Czechoslovakia. For the most part, the Czech. version was very similar to the Russian types, but this version used a special rubber cup which covered the inlet/outlet assembly. It is unknown what this feature was used for, but it is possible that it offered extra protection where a leak could occur. The corrugated rubber hose and the tall filter canister are also very similar to the Soviet models.</Notes>
