The mask consisted of a simple face piece made of a rubberized material with a filter canister mounted in the snout position. There was no exhale valve present, which meant expired air had to be pushed out through the sides of the mask or back through the filter canister. This feature made the mask prone to fogging. So, like the British Small Box Respirator, the Gummischutzmaske was designed to give the wearer the ability to wipe condensation from the eye pieces without removing the mask. This was accomplished by using a finger to push the face piece material in and underneath the eye pieces on the inside of the mask to wipe free the moisture. Another interesting feature of this early mask was the head harness. Instead of elastic, the head harness was adjusted via several straps made from crinkled fabric and small metal springs.</li></ul>

The material chosen was leather, which could be treated to neutralize the current gases being used at the time. A small filter canister fixed in the snout position was still used, as was a small metal carrying canister. The celluloid eye pieces were reinforced with additional metal frame on the inside of the mask similarly to the French A.R.S. artillery model. Like the Gummischutzmaske, the Lederschutzmaske GM17 did not have an exhale valve. However, a later version of the GM17 was updated with a small exhale valve on the side of the face piece. The Lederschutzmaske GM17 was made in quite significant numbers, making it one of the more easily found WWI gas masks today.</li></ul>

It was a near total departure from the old WWI design, particularly considering the fact that a long breathing hose was used with a large filter instead of a small filter mounted in the chin position. However, this setup did not last long, as the GM-30 (see below) design reverted back to mounting a smaller filter directly to the face piece within the same decade. It is possible that the use of a breathing tube and larger filter had mostly to do with an increasing amount of different chemical agents that the mask needed to protect against. The face piece of the GM-24 is very similar in overall appearance to the later GM-30, which obviously was derived directly from the GM-24 design. GM-24 gas masks are now very scarce and difficult to find in good complete condition.</li></ul>

The style of the GM-30 was used as a basis for several different gas masks made in Germany throughout WWII, as well as several other European countries. However influential the GM-30 was, its roots were still based in the earlier GM-24, which used a hose tube and a large filter. The GM-30 was typically carried and slung in in a tall metal canister. The GM-30's exhale valve was later updated to incorporate a protective cover (see below). It might also be noted that there are several variants of the GM-30 with different paint colors and canvas colors. The version pictured to the right was most likely a civilian model or an export model. The civilian version of the GM-30 was referred to as the S-Maske. The GM-30 was later updated and re-designated the GM-38 (see below).</li></ul>

The Gasbettchen was designed to fit a wide range of small children and babies that were not independently mobile yet. The device was basically a large fabric bag that was fitted over a wood frame. One side of the bag had an opening where the child could be inserted into the enclosure. The open end could then be "rolled-up" and clipped shut creating a gas-tight seal. A bellows attached to a long tube was then used by a caretaker to pump in filtered air, while the child could be observed via a large plastic window at the top. Expired air was pushed out through a one-way check valve above the plastic window.</li></ul>

The Gasjäckchen however was designed for children old enough to walk around on their own. The Gasjäckchen was made to fit over the arms, head and torso of the child. The openings on the jacket were tied tightly around the wrists and waist to create a gas proof seal. Their was also a plastic visor and and exhale valve present similar to the ones used for the Gasbettchen.</li></ul>

Germany was no exception. The Optische Gasmaske GM-44 was designed with two small, glass eye pieces that were attached to a threaded, intra- ocular adjustment rod very similar to the design used by the US Army for MI Optical Mask. This allowed the eye pieces to be positioned closer or farther apart, allowing for a customized fit to the wearer's eyes. Inside the mask behind the eye pieces were eye cups that also aided the wearer when using binoculars or other similar sighting devices.The mask also included a threaded microphone inlet, that could be capped off when not in use. The face piece was made entirely of leather, with a fabric and leather head harness. From the face piece in the chin area extended a long corrugated rubber breathing tube that was attached to a filter canister. The whole unit was carried in a green metal can. It might also be noted that a variant of this mask may have been carried aboard German submarines. The Optical GM-44 is quite scarce today but most surviving examples seem to be found in excellent co nditio n.</li></ul>
