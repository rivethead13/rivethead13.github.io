However, there were some Canadian masks that were only used in Canada, but were still derived directly from British designs. The Canadian Civilian Respirator is one of these masks. Its design is for the most part identical to the British General Civilian Respirator, however the Canadian version was made from a khaki material instead of black rubber. The Canadian version was even stored in a similar cardboard box like the British version. Canadian WWII Civilian Respirators are quite common, and can usually be found in mint, unissued condition for reasonable prices.</li></ul>

The Canadian version would be Brown Instead of Black and Green.) Another WWII Canadian design derived directly from the British was used for a Baby's Anti-Gas Helmet produced for what seems to be exclusive issuance in Canada. The Canadian Helmet is very similar at a glance, but there are many notable differences. The first being the obvious color difference; British Baby's Anti-Gas Helmets were made of black and green materials, while the Canadian types were made of mostly brown materials. Another obvious difference can be seen in the shape of the window. British Infant Carriers used a more oval shaped pane, while the Canadian version used more of a rectangular shape. The Canadian version also used a rounded metal wire frame as opposed to a flattened metal frame. Another significant difference is the shape of the bellows. It might also be noted that the Canadian version seems to be quite rare, which the British types were made in large numbers and are fairly easy to find today in excellent condition.</li></ul>

The mask's face piece was made from simple sheet rubber sealed at the chin. A 40mm filter canister was attached to the bottom of the mask and a rubber exhale valve was positioned on the front of the mask, just below the single clear plastic window. A six strap elastic head harness was used for suspension. This mask is somewhat rare today, but when found is usually in good condition.</li></ul>

Early versions of the Canadian C3 used a 60mm threaded filter canister which was mounted on the cheek of the face piece. The C3 remained in service for several years and was later updated with a filter inlet coupler that allowed 40mm threaded canisters to be used to conform with NATO standards. Canadian C3s are still very easy to find on the surplus market and are typically inexpensive.</li></ul>
