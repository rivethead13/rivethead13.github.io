Kumant and a Russian chemist named Nikolai Zelinsky developed what came to be known as the Zelinsky-Kumant gas mask. This was the start of a long trend of Russian 'helmet' type gas masks. The Zelinsky-Kumant consisted of a mask of thick rubber that encapsulated the wearers entire head, thus eliminating the need for a head harness. The protrusion from the nose area of the mask was typically turned inside out (and into the mask) which allowed the wearer to insert a finger and wipe the eye pieces clear when they fogged up. Another unique feature of the Zelinsky-Kumant design, was that the mask itself could be folded and stored inside a metal lid that fit snugly on top of the filter. This made the entire unit quite easy to carry and stow when not in use. There were at least two or three variations of the Zelinsky-Kumant made during the WWI era and all are most certainly difficult masks to find today. Most were either disposed of or destroyed over the years. The example pictured is in excellent preserved condition for its age.</li></ul>
