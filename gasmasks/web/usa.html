It used a similar carrier, filter and head harness. The mask's face piece was also designed so the wearer could wipe the eye pieces clean with a finger from the outside of the mask, again copying the British mask. But, soon after the A.S.B.R. went into production, it was found to have many shortcomings, particularly within the filter unit. So, the A.S.B.R. was quickly replaced by the Corrected English Model (see below). Remaining A.S.B.R.s had the top of the filter canister painted red, and the mask was then only used for drills and training exercises. Thus, it became known as the Training Mask. The A.S.B.R. is easily identified by the presence of the tall black and red filter canister and the lack of any type of exhale valve guard. While over 25,000 A.S.B.R.s were produced, the mask remains to be one of the more difficult US W.W.I masks to find today.</li></ul>

After the failure of the American Small Box Respirator, the C.E.M. was developed in an attempt to fix many of the problems with earlier box respirator designs. Several different developments were made over the years while the C.E.M. was in production, and before the end of W.W.I, nearly 2 million C.E.M. masks were produced. Because of the rapid pace of research at the time, several different variants of the C.E.M. were manufactured. The most common versions came with a yellow 'H' filter canister and a thin metal exhale valve guard. However, later versions of the mask used the improved 'J' type filter which was painted green. In addition, some later variants used a wider metal exhale valve guard to better protect the fragile, 'flapper' type exhale valve.</li></ul>

Featured a green type 'J' filter canister and a different exhale valve guard made from wider pieces of metal. This most likely helped protect the rubber 'flapper type' exhale valve from getting torn off in the field. It might also be noted that the C.E.M. was manufactured with both glass eye pieces and celluloid eye pieces (glass however, seems to be more common). Also, most C.E.M. masks are usually stamped 'C.E.' on the chin just behind the exhale valve, making them easily identifiable. The C.E.M. can still be found in excellent condition with the flutter valve intact, but masks in this shape usually bring high prices on the collectors market.</li></ul>

Mainly, the mask used a different head harness, consisting of two straps on either side of the forehead, as opposed to just one in the center as with the Corrected English Model. The R.F.K.'s face piece was also shaped a little differently than the C.E.M., giving it a wider appearance when worn. While more R.F.K. masks were produced during the war period, they seem to be somewhat more difficult to find, especially in good condition.

The filter canister was suspended behind the wearers head and was connected to a single corrugated rubber tube that attached to an inlet on the left side of the face piece. Inside the mask, air was directed over the circular glass eye pieces to aid demisting. Exhaled air was pushed out through a rubber exhale valve (missing in photo) fitted to an opening on the front of the mask.

II Head Canister Gas Mask is certainly the most peculiar. The filter canister was worn on top of the head as part of an integrated helmet-like, metal support system. Air was inhaled through an opening in the back of the filter canister and drawn through to the front of the canister and down into the mask via two short rubber hoses that connected just above the eye pieces. Exhaled air was directed up and out through a flapper type exhale valve located on the forehead of the mask. The mask was also issued with two rectangular 'filter pads' that were connected to a metal assembly that could be attached to the filter canister in the rear. These pads were used to capture smoke and other particles. The WWI US Navy Mark II is quite rare, and when found, is usually in very poor condition.</li></ul>

It was initially called the K.T.M. mask, but soon came to be known as the Model 1919. The mask's face piece was made from a special sheet of stockinet covered rubber, which was sewn together at the chin to create a proper face form. This gave the mask a higher level of protection and a better fit than any previous designs. In the years to follow leading up to the start of W.W.II, the K.T.M. went through many significant changes, particularly with the filter. Early versions of the mask used a blue painted box type filter canister that was continually modified until the standardization of the MIXA1 heavy- weight canister. The K.T.M. was finally standardized as the Army MI Service Gas Mask in 1921 after several changes to the filter, hose tube and carrier.</li></ul>

It should also be noted that a 'SS' or 'Super Small' version of some service masks were produced during the late war years as well (see below).</li></ul>

The M5-11-7 was originally inspired by the British MK. I Light Anti-Gas Respirator and was intended to be a light weight mask that soldiers could carry during amphibious assaults. Thus, the mask was issued with a carrier made of a waterproof rubberized duck material which doubled as a floatation device when in use. The M5-11-7 was quickly phased out when it was discovered that the neoprene face piece was subject to a hardening known as "cold-set". While the M5-11-7 always brings a high price on the surplus/collector's market, it is still quite common and can be found in mint, un-issued condition.</li></ul>

The front of the face piece was fitted with a metal speech diaphragm assembly which was situated just above a flutter type exhale valve. This configuration meant that the breathing tube could not be connected directly to the face piece. Instead, a hard plastic tube was fitted into two holes on either side of the face piece with the breathing tube connected to the center of the tube (angled slightly forward). The M3 Diaphragm mask was manufactured in significant numbers, and is thus not difficult to locate on the collector's market, however this early version with black metal parts and black head harness seems to be more scarce.</li></ul>

The distance between the small round eye pieces could be adjusted via a threaded rod, accommodating a wide range of head sizes. The mask's filter canister was suspended behind the wearer's neck by means of a metal clip on the filter that was attached to a canvas sleeve sewn onto the head harness. Inhaled air was drawn through a horizontal slit in the filter. Today, the Army MI Optical Gas Mask is among the rarest of the WWII US gas masks.

These masks were altered aboard ships and stowed in "damage-control" repair lockers. If needed, a diver could don the mask, which was connected to a air supply line, and dive up to depths of 36 feet. The peculiar example pictured to the right appears to fit the description of such modified gas masks almost perfectly. However, the example pictured to the right features an early Western Electric microphone in place of the diaphragm. The microphone connection cord has been cut, which means it could have been quite long (long enough for a 36 foot dive), and would also suggest that the microphone is water-proof as well as air-tight. The filter canister was removed and in place a "T" shaped brass connector was inserted and sealed with cement. These "on-the-fly" modified gas masks are quite scarce today in any condition.</li></ul>

The mask was used as a short term oxygen generating rescue apparatus for emergency situations where the oxygen level in the air was too low to sustain life, or other harmful gases were present. When the canister seal was broken, a chemical reaction forced oxygen into a large bladder that was worn around the front of the body. Expired air was breathed back into the canister and recycled back into oxygen for re-breathing. Each canister could be used for 30 to 45 minutes before a fresh canister had to be installed. A starter valve on the front of the mask allowed the wearer to breath outside air while the chemical reaction inflated the breathing bag with oxygen. Once this process was complete, the starter valve could be closed and re-breathing could begin. The N.O.R.B.A. is somewhat rare today, and when found most are in poor and/or incomplete condition.</li></ul>

An adjustable five strap rubber head harness was used for suspension and two C1 filter discs were used for filtration. The speech diaphragm and exhale valve are clearly visible on the front of the mask. The Mark V came in a special gray fabric carrier that was reinforced with an angled piece of flat metal.

The chin area was shaped to accommodate the wearers chin and thus created a better fit. The MIV button type exhale valve was replaced with the widely used M8 exhale valve. The large fixed filter was secured in place with a metal band as opposed to a rubber band, making it more durable and less likely to leak.</li></ul>

The muzzle piece was made from layers of gauze like material that could be soaked in a gas proof solution prior to use. The E1R1 project was short lived, and plans to design a protective mask for dogs were abandoned shortly afterword, not to be picked up again until the mid 1940s.

A M8 exhale valve was positioned on the bottom of the mask, directing spent air downward. The E12R8 was not used because the filter placement most likely caused refuse to get trapped in the intake slots as the dog tried to sniff the ground, thus blocking outside air. In addition, a single filter unit may not have been sufficient for the animal to breath adequately during strenuous work.

Dual threaded filter discs identical to those used on the Navy NC-1 gas masks were used. A metal 'mud guard' was also attached to the filter inlets to prevent debris from clogging the air intake holes. Due to some obvious complications, the mask was never produced in significant numbers (only 1,409 were produced during the war period), and thus is quite scarce and can bring well over $1000 on the collector's market.</li></ul>

It is quite possibly an E52R27 prototype. It's overall design is very close to the standardized model (below) but with some notable differences. First off, the plastic eye pieces are much smaller and of a slightly different shape; a feature that was most likely updated for the final version to offer a better field of view. Also, the filter padding element is ruggedly fused and several of the seams seem to be hand "melded" together. The mask also has a black elastic head harness instead of the typical gray elastic harness. In addition, the masks carrier is of an early design also. Because the mask bears no mold markings or dates, it is difficult to positively identify it. Either way, it is a scarce early production model, and not easily obtained on the collector's market.</li></ul>

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the M20 is that it used the familiar MSA All Service type face piece, a design that remained in use from the 1920s, well into the 1980s. The M20 was housed in a large olive-drab carrying trunk, similar to the commercial MSA re-breather units.
