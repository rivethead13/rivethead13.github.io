It used a helmet design similar to its WWI predecessor, but was made of thick molded rubber instead of glued sheet rubber. The face piece was referred to as the Шлем-Маска (Helmet Mask) but was also sometime called the БН-T5, which referred to it being an Army mask that used the T-5 type filter canister. A long corrugated breathing hose connected the face piece to the large metal filter unit, which was carried in a satchel at the wearer's side. A 'flapper' type exhale valve protected by a metal guard was also part of the assembly. When in use, the rubber protrusion between the eyes was turned in, to allow the wearer to insert a finger and wipe condensation from the eye pieces. Like all early Soviet gas masks, this type is quite scarce today as most were discarded after the end of the war.</li></ul>

Although they are very much alike, the Маска 0-8 should not be confused with the Маска МОД-0-8 (Mask MOD-O-8), a similar mask used during the same time period (see below).

It is possible that it was meant to be an updated version of the Маска 0-8, as its features are very similar. However, the Маска 0-8 did not have an inner mask or any Tissot tubes, making it prone to fogging, but the МОД-0-8 used a single tube on the inside of the mask to help reduce condensation on the eye pieces. The face piece is also slightly larger, and the rubber used was a bit thicker. This most likely made the МОД-0-8 more durable and possibly more comfortable. Like the Маска 0-8, the МОД-0-8 is very scarce today, and when found is usually in poor co nditio n.</li></ul>

The former Soviet Union used several variations of the ШМ-1 for military, civilian and industrial purposes well into the 1980s. Many other countries, including most of the Warsaw Pact states and even China used helmet styled masks derived directly from the Soviet models. The early ШМ-1 looks almost identical to its modern counter-parts, but there are several things that distinguish it from later versions. Most notably, the Tissot styled tubes on the inside of the mask are separate, black rubber pipes that were not part of the mask's face piece mold. The version pictured to the right is of the earliest type, with a metal band used to secure the inlet/outlet assembly instead of the later and more commonly used crimped metal assembly (see ШМ-1 below) Today, WWII era ШМ-1 gas masks are quite scarce in any condition.</li></ul>
